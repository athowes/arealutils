## Installation

This R package is being developed in support of the analysis in [`areal-comparison`](https://github.com/athowes/areal-comparison).
For this reason, many of the functions are relatively unlikely to be of great general use.
This disclaimer given, the package can be installed via:

```r
devtools::install_github("athowes/arealutils")
```

## `TMB` and `rstan`

This package uses compiled models from both `TMB` and `rstan`.
To do this we make use of the very helpful `TMBtools` and `rstantools` to set-up the package.
