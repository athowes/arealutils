\title{Fit constant Small Area Estimation model using \code{aghq}.}
\usage{
constant_aghq(sf, its = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{sf}{A simple features object with some geometry.}

\item{its}{Number of iterations in outer loop optimisation, passed to \code{nlminb}.}
}
\description{
Simply fits a constant (the mean). This is useful as a benchmark for other models.
